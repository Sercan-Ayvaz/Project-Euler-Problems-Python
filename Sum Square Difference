--------------Sum Square Difference--------------
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
    1²+2²+3²+.......+10²=385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
    (1+2+3+....+10)²=55²=3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is .
    3025-385=2640
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
